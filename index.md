Introduction
=====================
Progstr.Log is a service that collects and manages programmer log entries in the cloud. Most applications log errors and special external events generated by users or third party systems. Logging all can be both simple or complex and might grow into a full-blown application. Progstr.Log tries to do that for you. It is simple to use and gets you going in minutes, but it also takes care of the heavy lifting of involved in handling the log data your appliation generates. Our service takes away the pain of complex logging system configurations, provides a centralized location for all your log entries and helps you analyze the data youâ€™ve collected over time. **progstr-dotnet** is the Microsoft .NET client library that handles log entries and transports them to the central store.

Installation
-------------------------
*Progstr.Log.dll* is a regular .NET assembly that you need to drop in your project folder and refer from your application.

And here is how you integrate it in your project:

Sign up for Progstr.Log and obtain an API token. That token is used to identify you against the service. Keep it secret and do not share it with anyone unless you want to let them log messages on your behalf.
Download the binary distribution or compile progstr-dotnet from source. Copy *Progstr.Log.dll* to your project and add a reference.
Configure the API token by adding a "progstr.log.apitoken" entry to the `appSettings` section in your application config file (or the root web.config file for your web application):

{% highlight xml %}
<appSettings>
    <add key="progstr.log.apitoken" value="6f413b64-a8e1-4e25-b9e6-d83acf26ccba" />
</appSettings>
{% endhighlight %}

Getting Started
-------------------------
There are four log severity levels that you can use to log events of different importance:

* *Info*: used to log general information events that can be used for reference or troubleshooting if needed.
* *Warning*: something odd happened and somebody needs to know about it.
* *Error*: something failed and needs to be fixed.
* *Fatal*: the entire application or a critical part of it is not working at all.

To log an event you need to obtain an object implementing the `ILog` interface and call some of its Info/Warning/Error/Fatal methods. The easiest way to do that is to use the `Log()` extension method:

{% highlight csharp %}
using Progstr.Log;
...
...
this.Log().Info(message);
...
this.Log().Warning(message);
...
this.Log().Error(message);
...
this.Log().Fatal(message);
{% endhighlight %}

**Note the `using Progstr.Log;` line above. It is required by the compiler in order for the `Log()` method to work.**

Most logging libraries require that you initialize a log object with the current class and store it in a static field in that class where you can reuse it. We need a reference to that class, so that we can use its full name as a log source and easily distinguish which message got logged from which class. Modern C# lets us hide that complexity away by using generics and extension methods.

On some occasions it is not possible to use the `Log()` extension method. The most common scenario would be when logging from a static method. In that case, you can obtain an `ILog` object by calling the `Logs.Get()` static method:

{% highlight csharp %}
using Progstr.Log;
...
...
Logs.Get<MyClass>().Info(message);
{% endhighlight %}

Troubleshooting
------------------------
Of course, bad things do happen even to the best logging tools. A typical situation would be a bad or missing API token or a network error (say our server is unreachable due to a network or a firewall configuration problem). We can't have a logging library throw exceptions all over the place and break your application if the network goes down. That's why we do nothing on the surface. Our library silently complains by logging a debug message that will be visible only if the program has a debugger attached. So, if nothing happens in your app and you don't see your logs reaching our service, launch your application in Visual Studio's debugger and check the Debug log in the Output window. Look for errors originating from the Progstr.Log classes such as:
